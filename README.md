# Switcheroo
## Installation (Debian/Ubuntu)

You must install SDL2 and SDL2_image for this to run, install both libraries using the following commands:
```
apt-cache search libsdl2
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
apt-cache search libsdl2-image
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```

Create executable using `make`, and you're all set :)
